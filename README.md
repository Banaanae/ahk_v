# ahk_v

ahk_v is a visual editor for AHK using blockly

It is currently quite early in development, but many simpler blocks and math functions are done

## Usage

Go to [github pages](https://banaanae.github.io/ahk_v/) to view and use the latest release

Most blocks behave exactly the same as their written counterparts on [the AHK v2 docs](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/), with the exception of non-native blocks, which will be documented at [the wiki](https://github.com/Banaanae/ahk_v/wiki) (WIP)
